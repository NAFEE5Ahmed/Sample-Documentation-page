## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Code and pre tag
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- I use the code tag to display the code and use pre tag to preserve the text formation of the code.
- I learned to display the html code in browser which is different, for this we have to use (lt and gt instead of less than and greater than sign) like this "&lthead&gt".
